# This file describes the structure and format of a component telemetry schema.
# A component telemetry schema can be used for three types of purposes:
# - defining the telemetry schema for an application or a service
# - defining the telemetry schema for a library
# - defining a semantic convention registry
file_format: 1.2.0
schema_url: <url-of-the-current-component-schema>
# This optional field allows to specify the parent schema of the current schema.
# The parent schema is a resolved schema.
parent_schema_url: <url-of-a-parent-resolved-schema>

# This optional section allows for importing a semantic convention registry
# from a git repository containing a set of semantic convention files. It is
# also possible to import file by file.

# The resource field is defined when the component schema is that of an
# application (as opposed to that of a library). The resource field contains a
# list of local references to attributes defined in the shared catalog within
# this file.

  # from the semantic conventions (if any).
  attributes: # attribute definitions

# This optional section defines the instrumentation library, its version, and
# the schema of OTel entities reported by this instrumentation library (
# representing an application or a library component).
# This section is not defined if the current component telemetry schema is only
# used to represent a semantic convention registry.
