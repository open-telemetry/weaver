> This project is a **work in progress and is not ready for production use**.

OpenTelemetry Weaver is a CLI tool that enables users to:

- Manage Semantic Convention Registries: check, generate, resolve, search, stats commands.
- Manage Telemetry Schemas: check, generate, resolve, search, stats commands.

Note: Telemetry Schema commands are only available with the --features experimental flag.

## Install

Currently, there is no binary distribution available. To install the tool, you
must build it from source. To do so, you need to have Rust installed on your
system (see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).

To build the tool:

- In debug mode, run the following command:
  ```
  cargo build
  ```
- In release mode, run the following command:
  ```
  cargo build --release
  ```

The generated `weaver` binary will be located in the `target/debug` directory
for debug mode or the `target/release` directory for release mode.

## Usage

```

```

### Crates Layout

This project utilizes the concept of a cargo workspace to organize the
libraries developed for the OTel Weaver project. The set of crates in the
workspace is grouped under the directory `crates/*`. Adding a crate under this
directory will automatically include it in the OTel Weaver project due to the
directive `members = [ "crates/*" ]` included in the main `Cargo.toml` under the
`[workspace]` section.

This project has not been published to crates.io and will not be until it is
ready for production use.

Every crate in the workspace must have a `README.md` file that describes the
purpose of the crate and how to use it. Furthermore, the name of each crate
must be prefixed with `weaver_` to avoid any conflicts with existing crates on
crates.io.

The following is a list of crates in the workspace, along with a brief
description and the current status of each crate:

| Crate                                                             | Description                                                          | Status                 |

| [weaver_checker](crates/weaver_checker/README.md)     | Policy engine to enforce policies on telemetry data          | Alpha                  |
| xtask                                                             | Set of tasks to validate the project                                 | Done                   |

Note 1: Alpha status means that the crate is in a usable state but may have
limited functionality and/or may not be fully tested.

Note 2: Work-In-Progress status means that the crate is still under active
development.

### Architecture

The OpenTelemetry Weaver tool is architecturally designed as a platform. By default, this
tool incorporates a template engine that facilitates Client SDK/API generation
across various programming languages. In the future, we plan to integrate a
WASM plugin system, allowing the community to enhance the platform. This would
pave the way for features like enterprise data catalog integration, privacy policy enforcement,
documentation generation, dashboard creation, and more.

Below is a diagram detailing the primary components of the OpenTelemetry Weaver tool.
