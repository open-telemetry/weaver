## What is OpenTelemetry Weaver?

**OTel Weaver** is a comprehensive tool designed to enable developers to
easily develop, validate, document, and deploy semantic conventions (phase 1)
and application telemetry schemas (phase 2). As an **open, customizable, and
extensible platform**, it aims to serve both as a standalone developer tool
and as an integral component within CI/CD pipelinesâ€”whether for the
OpenTelemetry project itself, other open-source projects, vendor solutions,
or even large-scale enterprise deployments leveraging OpenTelemetry.

## Semantic Conventions and Application Telemetry Schema

- **Semantic conventions** enable SMEs to define a catalog of well-defined and reusable
  attributes and signals. OpenTelemetry maintains an official Semantic Convention
  Registry that any project can leverage for consistent instrumentation.
  Open-source projects, vendors, and enterprises can also implement their own
  registries for specific needs, which Weaver can import and resolve to cover all
  instrumented components of complex systems.
- **Application Telemetry Schema** allows developers to specify the semantic
  convention registries and custom attributes and signals supported by their
  applications. The vision behind this concept is detailed in this [document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/0243-app-telemetry-schema-vision-roadmap.md),
  with implementation planned for Weaver's phase 2.

## Design Principles

Weaver is built upon principles of extensibility, customizability, scalability,
robustness, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Features

- **Schema Resolution**: The Weaver Resolver sub-project resolves references,
  extends clauses, and overrides in semantic convention registries and application
  telemetry schemas, producing self-contained, easy-to-process, and shareable
  resolved schemas.
- **Policy Enforcement**: The Weaver Checker sub-project ensures the quality,
  maintainability, and extensibility of registries and schemas by checking them
  against a set of declarative policies using the popular rego policy language.
- **Documentation and Code Generation**: The Weaver Forge sub-project generates
  documentation and code from registries and schemas. It leverages a `jq-compatible`
  expression language for data transformation and a `jinja2-compatible` template
  engine for output generation.
- **WASM-based Plugin System (future plan)**: A plugin system based on WASM will
  be implemented to extend the Weaver platform. Plugins could be designed to
  download registries and schemas from custom systems, feed data catalog solutions,
  or configure dashboard systems, among other functionalities.

## Scalability

- Built with Rust, Weaver offers performance comparable to C or C++ implementation.
  The entire OpenTelemetry semantic convention registry can be downloaded, resolved,
  and documented in under 2 seconds.
- Semantic Convention Registry Git repositories can be efficiently cached locally.
- Registry and schema validation, as well as documentation and code generation,
  are parallelized for optimal performance.

## Robustness and Reliability

- **Memory Safety**: Rust ensures memory safety, preventing common vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Error Reporting**: Weaver reports as many errors as possible in
  a single pass, providing developers with comprehensive feedback.
- **Quality Assurance**: Code coverage, Cargo deny, Dependabot, and automated security
  audits.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Tested Platforms: Weaver is manually tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Future Plans: Automated tests will be implemented for broader platform coverage.

## Getting started

Currently, there is no binary distribution available. To install the tool, you
must build it from source. To do so, you need to have Rust installed on your
system (see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).

To build the tool:

- In debug mode, run the following command:
  ```
  cargo build
  ```
- In release mode, run the following command:
  ```
  cargo build --release
  ```

The generated `weaver` binary will be located in the `target/debug` directory
for debug mode or the `target/release` directory for release mode.

To run a registry check, use the following command:
```
cargo run -- registry check
```

This command will check the OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention Registry by
default.

To check a set of policies against the registry, use the following command:
```
cargo run -- registry check -b path/to/policies
```

An example of a policy file can be found here [schemas/otel_policies.rego](schemas/otel_policies.rego).

## Main commands

In phase 1, the only supported commands are related to the management of
Semantic Convention Registries. The following commands are available:

| Command                                                                   | Description                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| [weaver registry check](docs/usage.md#registry-check)                     | Check the validity of a semconv registry    |
| [weaver registry resolve](docs/usage.md#registry-resolve)                 | Resolve a semconv registry                  |
| [weaver registry generate](docs/usage.md#registry-generate)               | Generate artifacts from a semconv registry  |
| [weaver registry update-markdown](docs/usage.md#registry-update-markdown) | Update semconv snippet-based markdown files |
| [weaver registry stats](docs/usage.md#registry-stats)                     | Generate statistics on a semconv registry   |

Phase 2 will introduce commands related to the management of Application
Telemetry Schemas.
