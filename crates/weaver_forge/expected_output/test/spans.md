]
  
- Stability: Stable
  

#### Attribute `db.instance.id`

An identifier (address, unique name, or any other identifier) of the database instance that is executing queries or mutations on the current connection. This is useful in cases where the database is running in a clustered environment and the instrumentation is able to record the node executing the query. The client may obtain this value in databases like MySQL using queries like `select @@hostname`.

    0,
    2,
]
  

#### Attribute `db.cassandra.table`

The name of the primary Cassandra table that the operation is acting upon, including the keyspace name (if applicable).


This mirrors the db.sql.table attribute but references cassandra rather than sql. It is not recommended to attempt any client-side parsing of `db.statement` just to get this property, but it should be set if it is provided by the library being instrumented. If the operation is acting upon an anonymous table, or more than one table, this value MUST NOT be set.

In some SQL databases, the database name to be used is called "schema name". In case there are multiple layers that could be considered for database name (e.g. Oracle instance name and schema name), the database name to be used is the more specific layer (e.g. Oracle schema name).

- Requirement Level: Conditionally Required - If applicable.
  
- Tag: call-level

The client may obtain this value in databases like MySQL using queries like `select @@hostname`.



- Requirement Level: Optional
  
- Tag: connection-level
  
- Type: string
- Examples: mysql-e26b99z.example.com
  

#### Attribute `db.elasticsearch.cluster.name`

#### Attribute `db.elasticsearch.path_parts`

A dynamic value in the url path.



Many Elasticsearch url paths allow dynamic values. These SHOULD be recorded in span attributes in the format `db.elasticsearch.path_parts.<key>`, where `<key>` is the url path part name. The implementation SHOULD reference the [elasticsearch schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification/main/output/schema/schema.json) in order to map the path part values to their names.

- Requirement Level: Conditionally Required - when the url has dynamic values
  
- Tag: call-level-tech-specific
  
- Type: template[string]
- Examples: [
    "db.elasticsearch.path_parts.index=test-index",
    "db.elasticsearch.path_parts.doc_id=123",
]
  

#### Attribute `db.operation`

The endpoint identifier for the request.


When setting this to an SQL keyword, it is not recommended to attempt any client-side parsing of `db.statement` just to get this property, but it should be set if the operation name is provided by the library being instrumented. If the SQL statement has an ambiguous operation, or performs more than one operation, this value may be omitted.

- Requirement Level: Required
  
- Tag: call-level-tech-specific
  
- Type: string
- Examples: [
    "search",
    "ml.close_job",
    "cat.aliases",
]
  

#### Attribute `db.statement`

    "\"{\\\"query\\\":{\\\"term\\\":{\\\"user.id\\\":\\\"kimchy\\\"}}}\"",
]
  

#### Attribute `http.request.method`

HTTP request method.


HTTP request method value SHOULD be "known" to the instrumentation.
By default, this convention defines "known" methods as the ones listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods)
and the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.

If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override
the list of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods
(this list MUST be a full override of the default known method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults).

HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method` attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent.
Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set `http.request.method_original` to the original value.

- Requirement Level: Required
  
- Tag: call-level-tech-specific
  
- Type: Enum [CONNECT, DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT, TRACE, _OTHER]

- Stability: Stable
  

#### Attribute `server.address`

Name of the database host.



When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

- Requirement Level: Recommended
  
- Tag: call-level-tech-specific

]
  
- Stability: Stable
  

#### Attribute `url.full`

Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986)


For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.
`url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`. In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.
`url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed) and SHOULD NOT be validated or modified except for sanitizing purposes.

- Requirement Level: Required
