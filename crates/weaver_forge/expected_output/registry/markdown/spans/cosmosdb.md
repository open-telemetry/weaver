### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Requirement Level | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `db.system` | Enum | Required | An identifier for the database management system (DBMS) product being used. See below for a list of well-known identifiers.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.connection_mode` | Enum | Conditionally Required - if not `direct` (or pick gw as default) | Cosmos client connection mode.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.container` | `string` | Conditionally Required - if available | Cosmos DB container name.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.operation_type` | Enum | Conditionally Required - when performing one of the operations in this list | CosmosDB Operation Type.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.request_charge` | `double` | Conditionally Required - when available | RU consumed for that operation
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.status_code` | `int` | Conditionally Required - if response was received | Cosmos DB status code.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.sub_status_code` | `int` | Conditionally Required - when response was received and contained sub-code. | Cosmos DB sub status code.
 |
| `db.name` | `string` | Conditionally Required - If applicable. | This attribute is used to report the name of the database being accessed. For commands that switch the database, this should be set to the target database (even if the command fails).
 |
| `db.operation` | `string` | Conditionally Required - If `db.statement` is not applicable. | The name of the operation being executed, e.g. the [MongoDB command name](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/#database-operations) such as `findAndModify`, or the SQL keyword.
 |
| `server.port` | `int` | Conditionally Required - If using a port other than the default port for this DBMS and if `server.address` is set. | Server port number.
 |
| `db.connection_string` | `string` | Recommended | The connection string used to connect to the database. It is recommended to remove embedded credentials.
 |
| `db.cosmosdb.client_id` | `string` | Recommended | Unique Cosmos client instance id.

 |
| `db.instance.id` | `string` | Recommended - If different from the `server.address` | An identifier (address, unique name, or any other identifier) of the database instance that is executing queries or mutations on the current connection. This is useful in cases where the database is running in a clustered environment and the instrumentation is able to record the node executing the query. The client may obtain this value in databases like MySQL using queries like `select @@hostname`.
