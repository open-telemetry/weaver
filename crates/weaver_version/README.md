# Telemetry Schema Versioning and Schema Diff Data Model

This document describes the data model for OpenTelemetry schema versioning
(section `versions` in Telemetry Schema v1.1.0) and the schema changes data
model used in the weaver tool to represent differences between two versions
of a semantic convention registry.

For more information about the schema diffing process, see this
[document](/docs/schema-changes.md).
