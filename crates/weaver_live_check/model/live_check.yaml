  - key: weaver.finding.id
    type: string
    brief: "Unique identifier for the type of finding detected by the policy engine"
    note: |
      The finding ID is a stable, machine-readable identifier that categorizes the issue.
      Common examples include missing required attributes, deprecated attribute usage,
      invalid enum values, or naming convention violations. This ID can be used to
      filter, aggregate, or suppress specific finding types.

    examples:
      [
        "required_attribute_not_present",
        "undefined_enum_variant",
        "is_deprecated",
        "missing_attribute",

          value: "violation"
          brief: "A finding that breaks semantic convention compliance rules"
          note: >
            Violations represent hard errors in telemetry that break the semantic conventions.
            Examples include missing required attributes, using undefined attributes, or
            emitting malformed signal names.
          stability: development
        - id: improvement
          value: "improvement"
          brief: "A suggested change that would improve semantic convention compliance"
          note: >
            Improvements represent opportunities to enhance telemetry quality without being
            hard errors. Examples include using recommended attributes, upgrading from
            development to stable conventions, or following best practices.

        - id: information
          value: "information"
          brief: "Useful context about the telemetry without requiring action"
          note: >
            Information findings provide helpful context for understanding the telemetry
            or the validation results. For example, noting that a template attribute
            was used.
          stability: development
    brief: "Severity level of the semantic convention finding"
    note: >
      The level indicates how serious the finding is and what action should be taken.
      Violations should be addressed to achieve compliance, improvements are recommended
      for better quality, and information is provided for context.

  - key: weaver.finding.context
    type: template[any]
    brief: "Additional contextual information about the finding"
    note: |
      Context attributes provide structured details about what was found during validation.
      Each context field is flattened into a separate attribute using dot notation.
      For example, a context containing `{"attribute_name": "http.method", "expected": "http.request.method"}`
      would be recorded as two attributes:

      - `weaver.finding.context.attribute_name`: `"http.method"`
      - `weaver.finding.context.expected`: `"http.request.method"`

      The context structure varies by finding type but commonly includes details like
      attribute names, expected values, stability levels, and deprecation reasons.
    stability: development
    examples:
      - "http.method"
      - "http.request.method"

    brief: "The type of telemetry sample being validated"
    note: |
      This indicates what kind of OpenTelemetry data structure was analyzed.
      The sample type helps categorize findings and understand which part of
      the telemetry pipeline generated the issue.

          stability: development
    brief: "The OpenTelemetry signal type that the finding applies to"
    note: |
      The signal type categorizes the finding according to the OpenTelemetry data model.
      This helps correlate findings with specific parts of an observability system
      (traces, metrics, or logs).
    stability: development

  - key: weaver.finding.signal_name
    type: string
    brief: "The name of the specific signal being validated"
    note: |
      For metrics, this is the metric name (e.g., `http.server.request.duration`).
      For log events, this is the event name (e.g., `exception`).
      For spans, this is the span name (e.g., `GET /api/users`).
      This field helps identify exactly which signal in the telemetry has the issue.
    stability: development
    examples:
      ["http.server.request.duration", "exception", "GET /api/users"]

  - key: weaver.finding.resource_attribute
    type: template[any]
    brief: "Resource attributes from the original telemetry source that produced the finding"
    note: |
      When a finding is emitted as an OTLP log record, the resource attributes from the
      original telemetry signal are included with this prefix. This allows identifying
      which service or application produced the telemetry that triggered the finding,
      which is essential in CI environments with multiple instrumented applications.

      For example, if the original telemetry had resource attribute `service.name: "my-app"`,
      the finding log record would include `weaver.finding.resource_attribute.service.name: "my-app"`.
    stability: development
    examples:
      - "my-app"
      - "1.2.3"

events:
  - name: weaver.live_check.finding
    stability: development
    brief: "A semantic convention validation finding emitted by Weaver Live Check"
    note: |
      This event is emitted when Weaver Live Check validates telemetry samples against
      OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and detects violations, improvement opportunities,
      or informational issues. Each finding represents a single policy check result.

      The event body contains a human-readable message describing the finding, while
      the attributes provide structured, machine-readable details for filtering,
      aggregation, and automated processing.

      Severity levels are mapped as follows:

      - violation → ERROR severity
      - improvement → WARN severity
      - information → INFO severity

      These findings can be collected via OTLP and analyzed to improve telemetry
      quality, ensure semantic convention compliance, and identify instrumentation issues.
