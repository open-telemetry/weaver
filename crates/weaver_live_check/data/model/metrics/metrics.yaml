    brief: "The time the system has been running"
    note: |
      Instrumentations SHOULD use a gauge with type `double` and measure uptime in seconds as a floating point number with the highest precision available.
      The actual accuracy would depend on the instrumentation and operating system.

    brief: "Reports memory in use by state."
    note: |
      The sum over all `system.memory.state` values SHOULD equal the total memory
      available on the system, that is `system.memory.limit`.
