# Weaver Live Check Findings Reference

Weaver Live Check validates telemetry against OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and
emits structured findings as OTLP log records. This document describes the event schema,
attributes, and enumerations used by those findings.

## Event: `weaver.live_check.finding`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

A semantic convention validation finding emitted by Weaver Live Check

This event is emitted when Weaver Live Check validates telemetry samples against
OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and detects violations, improvement opportunities,
or informational issues. Each finding represents a single policy check result.

The event body contains a human-readable message describing the finding, while
the attributes provide structured, machine-readable details for filtering,
aggregation, and automated processing.

Severity levels are mapped as follows:

- violation → ERROR severity
- improvement → WARN severity
- information → INFO severity

These findings can be collected via OTLP and analyzed to improve telemetry
quality, ensure semantic convention compliance, and identify instrumentation issues.

## Attribute Details

### `weaver.finding.context.<key>`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Additional contextual information about the finding

**Type:** `template[any]`

Context attributes provide structured details about what was found during validation.
Each context field is flattened into a separate attribute using dot notation.
For example, a context containing `{"attribute_key": "http.method", "expected": "http.request.method"}`
would be recorded as two attributes:

- `weaver.finding.context.attribute_key`: `"http.method"`
- `weaver.finding.context.expected`: `"http.request.method"`

The context structure varies by finding type but commonly includes details like
attribute names, expected values, stability levels, and deprecation reasons.


**Examples:** `http.method`, `http.request.method`

### `weaver.finding.id`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Unique identifier for the type of finding detected by the policy engine

**Type:** `enum`

The finding ID is a stable, machine-readable identifier that categorizes the issue.
It can be used to filter, aggregate, or suppress specific finding types.

IDs prefixed with common patterns indicate the source: built-in advisors produce
findings like `missing_attribute` and `type_mismatch`, requirement-level checks
produce `*_attribute_not_present` findings, and Rego policies produce findings
like `missing_namespace` and `invalid_format`.

Custom Rego policies may emit additional finding IDs not listed here.

### `weaver.finding.level`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Severity level of the semantic convention finding

**Type:** `enum`

The level indicates how serious the finding is and what action should be taken. Violations should be addressed to achieve compliance, improvements are recommended for better quality, and information is provided for context.


#### Values

| Value | Stability | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `violation` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A finding that breaks semantic convention compliance rules |
| `improvement` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A suggested change that would improve semantic convention compliance |
| `information` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | Useful context about the telemetry without requiring action |

**`violation`**: Violations represent hard errors in telemetry that break the semantic conventions. Examples include missing required attributes, using undefined attributes, or emitting malformed signal names.

**`improvement`**: Improvements represent opportunities to enhance telemetry quality without being hard errors. Examples include using recommended attributes, upgrading from development to stable conventions, or following best practices.

**`information`**: Information findings provide helpful context for understanding the telemetry or the validation results. For example, noting that a template attribute was used.

### `weaver.finding.resource.attribute.<key>`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Resource attributes from the original telemetry source that produced the finding

**Type:** `template[any]`

When a finding is emitted as an OTLP log record, the resource attributes from the
original telemetry signal are included with this prefix. This allows identifying
which service or application produced the telemetry that triggered the finding,
which is essential in CI environments with multiple instrumented applications.

For example, if the original telemetry had resource attribute `service.name: "my-app"`,
the finding log record would include `weaver.finding.resource_attribute.service.name: "my-app"`.


**Examples:** `my-app`, `1.2.3`

---

### `weaver.finding.sample.type`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The type of telemetry sample being validated

**Type:** `enum`

This indicates what kind of OpenTelemetry data structure was analyzed.
The sample type helps categorize findings and understand which part of
the telemetry pipeline generated the issue.


#### Values

| Value | Stability | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `attribute` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A standalone attribute being validated |
| `span` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A span |
| `span_event` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | An event attached to a span |

| `resource` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A resource describing the telemetry source |
| `metric` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A metric measurement |
| `number_data_point` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A numeric data point within a metric |
| `histogram_data_point` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A histogram data point within a metric |
| `exponential_histogram_data_point` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | An exponential histogram data point within a metric |
| `exemplar` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | An exemplar (sample measurement) attached to a metric data point |
| `log` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | A log record or event |

### `weaver.finding.signal.name`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The name of the specific signal being validated

**Type:** `string`

For metrics, this is the metric name (e.g., `http.server.request.duration`).
For log events, this is the event name (e.g., `exception`).
For spans, this is the span name (e.g., `GET /api/users`).
This field helps identify exactly which signal in the telemetry has the issue.


**Examples:** `http.server.request.duration`, `exception`, `GET /api/users`

---

### `weaver.finding.signal.type`

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

The OpenTelemetry signal type that the finding applies to

**Type:** `enum`

The signal type categorizes the finding according to the OpenTelemetry data model.
This helps correlate findings with specific parts of an observability system
(traces, metrics, or logs).


#### Values

| Value | Stability | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `span` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | Distributed tracing span signal |
| `resource` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) | Resource describing the telemetry source |
