        stability: stable
        type: int
        brief: The number of messages sent, received, or processed in the scope of the batching operation.
        note: >
          Instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `messaging.batch.message_count` on spans that operate with a single message.
          When a messaging client library supports both batch and single-message API for the same operation, instrumentations SHOULD
          use `messaging.batch.message_count` for batching APIs and SHOULD NOT use it for single-message APIs.
        examples: [0, 1, 2]

        brief: "The message destination name"
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ["MyQueue", "MyTopic"]

        stability: stable
        type: string
        brief: Low cardinality representation of the messaging destination name
        note: >
          Destination names could be constructed from templates.
          An example would be a destination name involving a user name or product id.
          Although the destination name in this case is of high cardinality,
          the underlying template is of low cardinality and can be effectively
          used for grouping and aggregation.

        note: |
          The name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic, or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the original destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ["MyQueue", "MyTopic"]

          Message keys in Kafka are used for grouping alike messages to ensure they're processed on the same partition.

          If the key is `null`, the attribute MUST NOT be set.
        note: >
          If the key type is not string, it's string representation has to be supplied for the attribute.
