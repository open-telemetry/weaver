        brief: 'The message destination name'
        note: |
          Destination name SHOULD uniquely identify a specific queue, topic or other entity within the broker. If
          the broker doesn't have such notion, the destination name SHOULD uniquely identify the broker.
        examples: ['MyQueue', 'MyTopic']
