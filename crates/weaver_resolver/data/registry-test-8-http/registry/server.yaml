    brief: >
      These attributes may be used to describe the server in a connection-based network interaction
      where there is one side that initiates the connection (the client is the side that initiates the connection).
      This covers all TCP network interactions since TCP is connection-based and one side initiates the
      connection (an exception is made for peer-to-peer communication over TCP where the "user-facing" surface of the
      protocol / API doesn't expose a clear notion of client and server).
      This also covers UDP network interactions where one side initiates the interaction, e.g. QUIC (HTTP/3) and DNS.
    attributes:
      - id: server.port

        type: int
        brief: Server port number.
        note: >
          When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent
          the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.
