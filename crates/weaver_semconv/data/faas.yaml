      This semantic convention describes an instance of a function that
      runs without provisioning or managing of servers (also known as
      serverless functions or Function as a Service (FaaS)) with spans.

        note: |
          For the server/consumer span on the incoming side,
          `faas.trigger` MUST be set.

          Clients invoking FaaS instances usually cannot set `faas.trigger`,
          since they would typically need to look in the payload to determine
          the event type. If clients set it, it should be the same as the
          trigger that corresponding incoming would have (i.e., this has
          nothing to do with the underlying transport used to make the API
          call to invoke the lambda, which is often HTTP).
